We are excited to announce that this workshop will have proceedings!
They will be published in a special issue on change-point detection in [ESAIM: Proceedings and Surveys](https://www.esaim-proc.org/).
Each contribution will have its own DOI.

To foster discussions during the workshop, we propose to use an open reviewing process (see below) to share your contribution, read the other articles and review them!
The main idea is that we can all comment, propose some improvements, pinpoint references...
A final review will be done by the organizing committee for publication in Summer 2023.
 
### Guidelines
 
#### WHO?
Every participant to the conference can propose a paper (at least, one of the co-authors has to be registered at the conference).
Every participant is welcome to contribute to the review process.
 
#### WHEN?
From now on up to April the 30th 2023.
Reviewing process ends in May/June for publication in Summer 2023.
 
#### WHAT?
The objective is to publish important and original technical considerations that have not yet been detailed before, for instance:

- developing a proof (possibly of an already published paper),
- non-trivial algorithmic strategies,
- solution to standard caveats in change-point detection (e.g. estimating the noise level in a piecewise constant signal)
- etc.

Those subjects, which are of great interest, are often deferred to supplementary material as they are too technical.
Consequently, these proceedings should be considered as **a complement to your main research paper**.
Submissions should be from 5 to 15 pages long.
Participants can first submit an initial draft and improve it over time.

#### HOW?
Submissions must be made through the [OpenReview platform](https://openreview.net/group?id=PSCP%2F2023%2FWorkshop).
