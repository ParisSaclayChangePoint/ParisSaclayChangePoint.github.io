**Title:** A Solution to the Change-Point Problem based on Ranks, Self-normalization & Subsampling

**Abstract:** We consider change-point tests based on rank statistics to test for structural changes in time series data. Under the hypothesis of stationary time series, the asymptotic distributions of the corresponding test statistics are derived. For this, we consider a uniform reduction principle for the empirical process in a two-parameter Skorohod space equipped with a weighted supremum norm. Moreover, special emphasis is laid on an application-oriented approach to the mathematical results by considering self-normalized statistics and an approximation of the distribution of test statistics by subsampling procedures.

**Titre:** Online Centralized Non-parametric Change-point Detection via Graph-based Likelihood-ratio Estimation

**Abstract:** Consider each node of a graph to be generating a data stream that is synchronized and observed at near real-time. At a change-point ùúè, a change occurs at a subset of nodes *C*, which affects the probability distribution of their associated node streams.
In this work, we propose a novel kernel-based method to both detect ùúè and localize *C*, based on the direct estimation of the likelihood-ratio between the post-change and the pre-change distributions of the node streams. Our main working hypothesis is the smoothness of the likelihood-ratio estimates over the graph, i.e. connected nodes are expected to have similar likelihood-ratios.

**Title:** Change-point detection in dynamic networks with missing links

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of change-point detection in a sequence of
partially observed networks. The goal is to detect whether there is a change in the network
parameters. Our approach is based on the Matrix CUSUM test statistic and allows growing
size of networks. We show that the proposed test is minimax rate-optimal and robust to missing links.

**Title:** Uncovering Causality in Change Point Regressions

We propose a method for estimating graphs which encode (non-) causality between change points present in a moderate number of data streams. Typically after performing change point analysis relationships between estimated change points can only be described qualitatively, since in general change point locations are held to be unknown but non-stochastic. From the perspective of prac- titioners this is a limitation, since in many settings it is reasonable to believe change points will be causally linked. For example: in climatology changes in concentrations levels of certain gasses actively cause changes in the environment [1]. We model unobserved change point locations as arrival times of a marked point process, for which non-causality is well understood [2]. Estimated change point locations can therefore be seen as a noisy sample path of the same process, to which existing estimation procedures can be applied. We will give details of this ongoing work, and provide real data examples illustrating its practical value.

**Title:** A changepoint approach to modelling soil moisture dynamics 

**Abstract:** Soil moisture is an important measure of soil health that scientists model via soil drydown curves. The typical modelling process requires manually identifying the drying process and fitting exponential decay models to them, which can be time consuming. The result is a static overview of the drydown property.
Motivated by the spike-train problem in neuroscience, a changepoint-based approach is proposed to automatically identify structural changes in the soil drying process. Changes caused by sudden rises in soil moisture content over a long time series are captured and the parameters characterising the drying processes are estimated simultaneously. Segment specific parameters are used to capture potential temporal variations in the drying process. An algorithm based on the penalised exact linear time (PELT) method was developed to identify the changepoints. Applying the algorithm to simulated and real data show good performance of the method. 
To improve the flexibility of the modelling approach, so that periods corresponding to no drying as a result of low temperature or saturation can be segmented in addition to the exponential decay periods, an approach based on the on-line inference for multiple changepoints problems is currently under development. It allows the selection of different types of models to describe the segments with distinctively different patterns. Extension to estimate the parameters unique to each segment is also being investigated.

**Title:** Detecting changes in mixed-sampling rate data sequences

**Abstract:** Different environmental variables are often monitored using different sampling rates; examples include half-hourly weather station measurements, daily CO<sub>2</sub> data and six-day satellite data. When researchers want to combine the data into a single analysis this often requires data aggregation or down-scaling. Further, when one is seeking to identify changes within multivariate data, the aggregation and/or down-scaling processes obscure the changes we seek. In this talk, we propose a novel changepoint detection algorithm which can analyse multiple time series for co-occurring changepoints with potentially different sampling rates, without requiring preprocessing to a standard sampling scale. We demonstrate the algorithm on synthetic data before providing an example identifying simultaneous changes in multiple variables at a location on the Greenland ice sheet using synthetic apature radar (SAR) and weather station data.

**Title:** Multiple change-point detection in a Poisson process 

**Abstract:** We consider a Poisson process whose intensity is supposed to be piecewise constant. The objective is to detect the instants of abrupt changes, called change-point, and to determine their number.
<br>
The main difficulty concerns the estimation of the change-points. Indeed, the based-likelihood contrast to be optimized for this purpose is not convex and nor even continous with respect to these parameters. This problem has been already considered in the literature for the detection of one change-point [1,2]. Using a concavity argument of the contrast on each time-event intervals, they showed that the optimal change-point is necessarly localized at an event or just before. For the detection of multiple change-points, we use the same idea and show that, for a general class of contrasts satisfying a concavity hypothesis w.r.t. the change-points, the optimization problem is thus reduced to a discrete optimization problem which can be solved using a well-efficient algorithm known used in the case of the detection of discrete change-points, the dynamic programming algorithm. The change-points are thus recovered in a exact manner and reasonnably fast.
<br>
For the choice of the number of change-points, we propose to use a cross-validation method taking advantage of the previous fast algorithm and a specific property of Poisson processes.
<br>
Simulation results will be presented as well as an illustration of volcanic eruption data.

**Title:** Ms.FPOP: An Exact and Fast Segmentation Algorithm With a Multiscale Penalty

**Abstract:** Given a time series in R^n with a piecewise constant mean and independent noises, we propose an exact dynamic programming algorithm to minimize a least square criterion with a multiscale penalty promoting well-spread changepoints. Such a penalty has been proposed in Verzelen et al. (2020), and it achieves optimal rates for changepoint detection and changepoint localization. Our proposed algorithm, named Ms.FPOP, extends functional pruning ideas of Rigaill 2015 and Maidstone et al. (2017) to multiscale penalties. For large signals, n>10^5, with relatively few real changepoints, Ms.FPOP is typically an order of magnitude faster than PELT. We propose an efficient C++ implementation interfaced with R of Ms.FPOP allowing to segment a profile of up to n=10^6 in a matter of seconds.

**Title:** Online changepoint test in a nonlinear expectile model

**Abstract:** An automatic data-driven changepoint test is presented to detect specific structural changes within an underlying stochastic model. The proposed methodology is based on a nonlinear (parametric) regression framework which ensures relatively large flexibility of the overall model. Conditional expectiles---well-known in econometrics for being the only coherent and elicitable risk measure---induce some robustness in the model estimation, and the proposed statistical test is proved to be consistent while the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis does not depend on the functional form of the underlying model neither on the unknown parameters. Therefore, relatively easy and straightforward practical application is guaranteed. Important theoretical details are discussed and finite sample empirical properties (simulations and real data example) are presented.

**Title:** Sequential detection of abrupt changes: some criteria and methods
 
**Abstract:** The goal of this presentation is to discuss the relation between the criteria of optimality in sequential detection of abrupt changes and the methods used to get the desired operating characteristics. The presentation is divided in three parts. The first part is devoted to the quickest detection of abrupt changes when the post-change hypothesis is simple or composite. The criterion is to minimize the (worst-case) mean detection delay for a given ARL to false alarm. Here we discuss how the a priori information on the post-change distribution affects the structure and operating characteristics of the sequential tests. We also discuss how the nuisance parameters in the pre- and post-change stochastic models affect the sequential tests. The second part is devoted to the quickest multidecision change detection/isolation problem, which is the generalization of the quickest changepoint detection problem to the case of M>1 post-change hypotheses. The criterion is to minimize the (worst-case) mean detection delay for a given ARL to false alarm and for a given probability of false isolation. A special attention will be paid to the case of M non-orthogonal post-change hypotheses. The comparison between the sequential and non-sequential or fixed sample size (FSS) tests will be also considered here for the cases of M=1 and M>1 post-change hypotheses. Finally, the third part is devoted to the reliable detection of transient changes, i.e., it is assumed that the duration of the post-change period is finite and usually short. Unlike the quickest sequential change detection, which assumes that the post-change period is infinitely long, we use here the probabilistic criterion of optimality, i.e., the worst-case probability of missed detection against the worst-case probability of false alarm during a reference period. We discuss the optimization of the window-limited CUSUM test and its comparison with the FSS test. Several typical real-life examples will be given to illustrate the theoretical ideas.

**Title:** On the importance of component-wise weighting a multi-dimensional sparse signal for detecting breakpoints

**Abstract:** Many automatic-monitoring applications record high-dimensional time-series. However only a small number of components carry some information (breaks in the mean of the signal), while the others are pure noise. In this high-dimensional context where the relevant signal is sparse, we design and study a new segmentation algorithm identifying the few really informative components from which better segmentations can be uncovered. The present work focuses on detecting changes in the mean of a multivariate signal that is sparse. We describe and study a two-step procedure inspired by ideas from sparse clustering. The first step consists in building a sparse weight vector applying component-wise, then reducing the influence of non-informative components and therefore the dimensionality of the time-series. In the second, the candidate change points are computed from the resulting weighted time-series. Simulated examples illustrate the contribution of the weighting procedure both in terms of dimensionality reduction and relevance of the output segmentations.

**Title:** High-dimensional change-point regression with structured information

**Abstract:** Observing a large number of time series of related processes at the same time occurs in more and more applications. Consequently, recently many works have considered the detection of change-points that occur in multiple of the time series simultaneously. Sharing the information of the change-point location among different time series increases detection power heavily. In this talk we will consider the situation where we additionally know that all changes have the same sign, i.e. all changes at a certain location are either upwards or downwards. We will propose methodology that have a larger detection power if this situation is given. We will discuss application where this setting occurs, show the increase of detection power in a minimax theory and in numerical simulations.

**Title:** Ex-FOCuS: A Constant-per-Iteration Likelihood Ratio Test for Online Changepoint Detection for Exponential Family Models

**Abstract:** Online changepoint detection algorithms that are based on likelihood-ratio tests have been shown to have excellent statistical properties. However, a simple online implementation is computationally infeasible as, at time *T*, it involves considering *O(T)* possible locations for the change. Recently, the FOCuS algorithm has been introduced for detecting changes in mean in Gaussian data that decreases the per-iteration cost to *O(log(T))*. This is possible by using pruning ideas, which reduce the set of changepoint locations that need to be considered at time *T* to approximately *log(T)*. We show that if one wishes to perform the likelihood ratio test for a different one-parameter exponential family model, then exactly the same pruning rule can be used, and again one need only consider approximately *log(T)* locations at iteration *T*. Furthermore, we show how we can adaptively perform the maximisation step of the algorithm so that we need only maximise the test statistic over a small subset of these possible locations. Empirical results show that the resulting online algorithm, which can detect changes under a wide range of models, has a constant-per-iteration cost on average.

**Title:** Optimal change-point detection and localization

**Abstract:** Given a times series, we consider the twin problems of detecting and localizing change-points in the distribution. This encompasses various models including mean univariate, sparse multivariate, non-parametric, or kernel change-points... Starting with the simple Gaussian univariate model, we derive optimal detection and localization rates and uncover phase transitions from regional testing problems to local estimation problems. Notably, our multi-scale procedures accommodate with the presence of possibly many low-energy and therefore undetectable change-points. In a second part, we explain how the methodology extends to more generic change-point problems by drawing some connection with minimax theory in multiple testing. This is based on joint works with A. Carpentier, M. Fromont, M. Lerasle, E. Pilliat, and P. Reynaud-Bouret.

**Title:** Weighted change-point tests based on two-sample U-statistics

**Abstract:** We study non-parametric tests for change-points in time series that are based on weighted two-sample U-statistics. By a suitable choice of weights, we obtain tests that are able to detect changes that occur very early or very late during the observation period. Our tests cover both the CUSUM and the Wilcoxon change-point test as well as many other robust and non-robust tests. We investigate the limit distribution of our test statisitc under the hypothesis that no change occurs, but also under the alternative that there is a change. We study two different types of alternatives. First, we allow both the location and the height of the change to depend on the sample size. Then, we consider the alternative where the jump height is kept constant while the time of change moves closer to the border. To illustrate the results and to investigate the power of the tests we will give some simulation results.

**Title:** Online change point localization in multilayer random dot product graph models

**Abstract:** We study the online change point localization problem in dynamic multilayer random dot product graphs (D-MRDPGs). To be specific, at every time point, we extend the nonparametric random dot product graph (RDPG) to the directed multilayer graph with the common node sets and the underlying distributions change when a change point occurs. The goal is to detect the change point as quickly as possible if it exists, subject to a constraint on the probability of false alarms. The change in our framework is in fact, a multivariate nonparametric distributional change. Instead of defining the jump size using a density, we use the expectation of the kernel density estimator (KDE). Our generic model setting allows the model parameters, including the number of nodes, the dimension of latent position, and the magnitude of the change, to vary as functions of the location of the change point. We propose a novel change point detection algorithm and proved an upper bound on the detection delay under a signal-to-noise ratio condition. Additionally, for a single multilayer random dot product graph (MRDPG), we study an estimation method based on the adjacency tensor and show it achieves the optimal statistical performance in estimation error. Finally, extensive numerical results including simulation studies and real data studies are provided to support our theoretical results.

**Title:** Detection of Epidemic Changes Based on Weighted U-Statistics

**Abstract:** To detect a changed segment (a so called epidemic changes) in a time series, variants of the CUSUM statistic are frequently used. However, they are sensitive to outliers in the data and do not perform well for heavy tailed data, especially when short segments are given high weights in the test statistic. We will present a robust test statistic for epidemic changes based on a weighted version of the Wilcoxon rank statistic. To study their asymptotic behavior, we prove functional limit theorems for general U-processes in H√∂lder spaces. We assume that the time series is short range dependent in the sense of absolute regularity. Under the alternative, we show that the test is consistent. We also study the finite sample behavior via simulations and apply the statistics to a real data example.

**Title:** Online distributed changepoint detection methods for monitoring the Internet of Things.

With the advent of the Internet of Things, it is increasingly common to have large networks of sensors. Each sensor has limited computing ability and the ability to transfer data to a central cloud. However, the communication between sensors and the cloud can be very expensive. Thus, this brings us a new challenge to detect changes within such a network in real time with as little communication and computation as possible.

We proposed two online, communication-efficient methods to detect the changes. Simulation results suggest that our methods can still be almost as good as the idealistic setting, where we have no constraints on communication between sensors, but substantially reduce the transmission costs when there is a dense change.
